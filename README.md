REdstone - CUBE Minecraft mod

This is my first Minecraft mod aiming at v1.21.1 under NeoForge.

The mod adds a simple block with a configurable GUI to send sequences of redstone signals.

Goals:
- receiving redstone to activate
- configuration sides to react to (input/output)
- Set up the configuration of the sequence
